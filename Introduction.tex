The $\Gamma$ function is useful in the solution developments for many physics problems.
When one first encounters it as a physicist, however, it is often presented far too opaquely. 
In this paper, however, you will find first-principles derivations of the most important properties and formulas for the $\Gamma$ function, in a manner familiar to the aspiring physicist.

We do assume some previous knowledge of analysis in $\R$, such as convexity.
Nevertheless, as a general rule, we have attempted to limit the methods in this paper to those most common in physics.
Additionally, we emphasize the $\Gamma$ function's use in solving real integrals and sums.
As such, given that you have some mental fortitude, this paper will give you the necessary tools to understand the $\Gamma$ function's role in mathematical physics.
